# OSRS-ping-tester
This python script asks a user for their region (AUS, EU, NA). Based off their region they select, it will test each server from that region 3 times. It then finds the top 10 best worlds for the user based on lowest average pings, and tells the user the top 10 worlds and the very best world they should be playing on.

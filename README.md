# OSRS-ping-tester
This python script asks a user for their region (AUS, EU, NA). Based off their region they select, it will test each server from that region 3 times. It then finds the top 10 best worlds for the user based on lowest average pings, and tells the user the top 10 worlds and the very best world they should be playing on.

If you would like to change how many times a server is tested to give a more accurate average time, then change "count = 3" to how many times you would like to test each server. You can find this in each function, AUS_pings(), NA_pings(), EU_pings(). Be sure to change the count in each function if you want to test multiple regions.

Also, please note that I am new to coding. I've been teaching myself python for the past few months and I wanted to start this as possibly a long-term project that I'm hoping to improve overtime. So the code will no doubt look sloppy compared to professional standards, but if you do have advice on making code look cleaner please feel free to tell me! I'm open to all advice. If you would also like to message me on discord about this project feel free, AWN3ST#1143

If you have any suggestions for this project/feedback please let me know as well! 

If Jagex does so happen to add new worlds, please feel free to notify me and I will update the list.
